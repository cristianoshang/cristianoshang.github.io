## About me

I am Xingyu, I received my M.S. degree from North China Electric Power University(NCEPU) in 2022. I received my B.S. degree from Hebei Finance University in 2015. 

My research interests lie in security & privacy of blockchain/AI. I have some experience with permissioned blockchain. One of my research projects is the privacy preserving of consortium blockchain.
